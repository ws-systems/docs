# Users

A user is somebody that can login with a username and password. Each individual using the system should have their own login, to ensure that accountability is maintained. User accounts can be created by any administrator/supervisor user.

To view a list of all users, click on the "Users" submenu in the Admin view.

Once the user has completed a transaction, either creating or authorizing, they cannot be deleted. This is done to preserve the integrity of the database. If you are not changing the user's password, leave both the "Password" and the "Confirm" boxes blank.
