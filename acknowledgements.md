# Acknowledgements

WhiteStar Docs are build from Markdown via [VueDocs](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress), an open-source documentation tool that makes use of the Vue component based layout system. This site uses a theme based off of the Default VuePress theme with some modifications for style and functionality.

Changes to the docs, as well as outside contributions, are managed by [GitHub](https://github.com/ws-systems/docs), who also provide the hosting via GitHub Pages. We would love for you to contribute to our docs! Found an error, typo, or want to help make things clearer for future readers, use the __"{{ this.$site.themeConfig.editLinkText }}"__ link at the bottom of most pages to submit your change request via GitHub.

[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/) provides the missing link between VuePress and GitHub Pages in the form of a build job that generates the production documentation files and pushes them to GitHub Pages. Details about this build can be found by clicnking on the build status indicator below.
